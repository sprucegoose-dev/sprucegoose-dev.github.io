Poem

Spleen was the first
To finish his wormheap

But Pipsqueak forgot —
He was the scorekeep…

Crusty Toe
And Pigsnout too
Their javelins threw
At the tree stump
Harooh!

Gruzzick from Jawbone
And Hunt-Hunt from Boarfoot
Went wart for wart
In every sport

The pimples they popped
The scabs they picked
The boils they lanced
The swill they swigged

Fussy and Snort
Were dirt-licking champions
At picking their noses
No one could outsnot them

They peeled off blackheads
And swallowed a grubstick

But the judges
Knew not
Who had won
Who would you pick?

The goblins all felt
Such rotten rejoice
An event such as this
Was their number one choice

The drums beat all day
The feet stamped all night
The swamp clanged and banged
With the goblins’ delight
