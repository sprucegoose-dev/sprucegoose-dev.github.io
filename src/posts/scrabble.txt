Story
The transistor radio was an old one, probably from the 50s. They didn’t make these anymore. No one listened to the radio anymore, except maybe commuters and long distance truck drivers. And Ethel, of course.
His roll-up toolkit was unfurled on the mantel beside the radio. He was holding the latter so that its exposed back was facing him, and absentmindedly groped for a wire cutter.
“It’s your turn,” Ethel said.
“I think I see the problem,” he said. He used the wire cutter to poke around the radio’s tangled guts. “One of the wires is fried.”
“Forty years at an electronics store. You would know.”
He snipped the blackened wire and fumbled for a spare from his kit.
Holly knocked on the opened door, and asked if they needed anything. Ethel smiled at her with teeth that gleamed in a plasticky sheen, and said no thank you.
He pretended not to notice the carer in her blue uniform, but sneaked a furtive glance at her departing backside.
“It’s your turn,” Ethel said. “Did you hear me?”
“Do you want this thing fixed or not?”
“But it’s your turn. My word was ‘gentle.’ Seven points.”
He sighed, put the radio and tools down, and joined her at the table. He glanced at the green Scrabble board and then at the letters on his tile rack: EAHTCER.
He stared at them for a while, his mind working to combine them into different words, but he kept coming back to the same one: “CHEATER.”
He looked up at Ethel in her white floral gown and Coke bottle glasses. She smiled at him. His eyes drifted to the open door, then back to the letters.
“Maybe we should…” That smile. “Maybe I should get back to the radio. It shouldn’t take much longer.”
“First play. It’s been broken for three days. It can stay broken for a few more minutes.”
The room suddenly felt very hot. His gnarled, liver-spotted fingers reached slowly for the letters, picked them up one by one, and placed them on the board on both sides of a “T” tile.
“‘Theatre,’” Ethel said. “How wonderful. Ten points.”
